    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is an Italian dish consisting of wide, flat sheets of pasta layered with fillings such as ragù 
        (meat and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, and various cheeses like ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan. 
        The assembled dish is typically baked in an oven until it is bubbly and golden brown. 
        It can also be made with other ingredients like vegetables or fish in place of meat. </p>
